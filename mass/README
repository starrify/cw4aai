This is MASS: Mips ASSembler by Pengyu CHEN(cpy.prefers.you@gmail.com).
COPYLEFT, ALL WRONGS RESERVED.

To build this distribution of source code, you must have flex, bison and gcc
installed. You can mail me to request a only-c-source distribution to get rid of
flex and bison.

For usage of MASS, use `mass -h' to check the help list.

Enjoy it!
